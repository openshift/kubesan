# The KubeSAN CSI Plugin

KubeSAN is a [CSI] plugin for [Kubernetes] that enables you to provision
volumes backed by a single, cluster-wide, shared block device (*e.g.*, a single
big LUN on a SAN), exposed as a shared Volume Group under lvm2.

Whilst SANs often come with vendor CSI plugins, they cannot always be used.
KubeSAN is intended for cases where:
- No vendor CSI plugin is available, the vendor plugin is broken, or lacks features.
- The vendor CSI plugin cannot be used due to organizational reasons (storage
  team does not want to give Kubernetes team access).
- 1 SAN LUN per `PersistentVolume` is undesirable for scalability or
  organizational reasons.

In these cases KubeSAN steps in to provide storage without help from a
vendor CSI plugin.

Features:
- Dynamic provisioning of `Block` and `Filesystem` volumes
- Snapshots
- Cloning
- `ReadWriteMany` (RWX) support for `Block` volumes
- Thin provisioning

Roadmap:
- [ ] Recovery after power failure. Currently requires manual intervention.
- [ ] Volume expansion
- [ ] Instant volume cloning via background copy
